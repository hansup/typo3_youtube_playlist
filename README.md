# typo3_youtube_playlist
TYPO3 Extension to select and display youtube playlists

Just install and use as a frontend plugin. 

The composer.json needs to be modified in order to use composer to update the google api client.
The "require-bak" property needs to be like this in order to work with TYPO3 6.2.* because of their own composer implementation. 
Otherwise it will throw an error because of missing installed extension google api client. 

# Requirements
    TYPO3 6.2 - 7.6
    VHS: Fluid ViewHelpers (latest)

# Install
    - Download and install the extension from TER or Composer
    - Add the TypoScript templates into your root or extension template

# Usage
    - Add the frontend plugin via "General Plugin"
    - Fill in the ChannelID of the playlists you want to display
    - Insert your YouTube Data API Server Token (https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api) | It needs to be a SERVER TOKEN!!
    - Save the Plugin Content Element and switch to the "Source"-Tab
    - If you've done right you will see all the available playlists of the channel
    - Select as many playlists as you want to be displayed at the frontend
        - The first playlist selected will be the main playlist. All further playlists are displayed under the player window
